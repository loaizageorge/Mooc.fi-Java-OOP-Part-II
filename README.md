# Mooc.fi-Java-OOP-Part-II
Mooc.fi-Object-Oriented programming with Java, part II
Just my own implementation of the excercises, some aren't the same as the suggested solution but this is just here in case anyone gets
stuck doing these and needs a reference. If anyone even finds this that is..maybe im just talking to myself right now.
Anyways if someone actually is reading this here you go.
As of April 16,2016 i have only completed up to Week 7 and Week 8 is a WIP.
If you need help the first part, shoot me a message, i dont have those up on here because i didnt think about it until i started the 
second week, and it would be tedious to do it now. I feel like i'm rambling, so im going to stop now.
